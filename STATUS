CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
      that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
      made in the trunk.

    * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
      as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
      get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
      branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

    * Bundled PCRE: backport r381783 from trunk
      Fix brokenness on certain platforms when building with -DDEBUG.
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=381783
      +1 sctemme, fielding
      -1 niq: Why are we hacking a third-party package as bundled,
              rather than upstream?  This has potential for chaos
              for modules (and we have a history of PCRE trouble)
              as well as a maintenance nightmare!

    * mod_isapi: Simply backport the host of fixes for compilation on unix,
      PR#'s 15993 29098 30022 16637 30033 28089
      by pushing to trunk/ rev 416293 of modules/arch/win32/mod_isapi.[ch]
      which compiles without changes.  Source + Binary posted at
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mod_isapi-416293.zip
      and delta posted at
        http://people.apache.org/~wrowe/mod_isapi-416293-to-httpd-2.2.patch
      +1 wrowe , fielding

    * mod_deflate: don't choke on flush buckets in INFLATE filter
      PR#39854
      http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=416165&view=rev
      +0: niq
          (this patch is now superseded by rpluem/wrowe better patch)
      -0: wrowe - on quick glance the line 1091 change looks incomplete,
          and I'm not convinced that we should ignore flush.  Has anyone
          inquired of the proper mechanism or composed the appropriate
          patch to finish an incomplete packet and resume encoding or
          this entirely impossible in the current scheme of things?
      rpluem: I discussed this with Justin at the ApacheCon and we discussed
              ways how to fix this and take care about the flush buckets.
              I am willing to propose patches, but due to personal time
              constraints they will not show up before the second half of July.
