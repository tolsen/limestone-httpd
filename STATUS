Contributors looking for a mission:

  * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

  * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

  * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

    After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]



PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

 * unixd: set suexec_enabled correctly when httpd is run by non-root
   PR 42175
   Trunk Patch: http://cvs.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=791337
   2.2.x Patch: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=20004
   +1: niq
   -0: wrowe; Please refer to man 'access' BUGS section about linux 2.4 
              vs 2.6 kernels, potentially a suspect test for root.
   sf:        Couldn't the linux 2.4 bug be worked around by calling access
              twice? Once with R_OK and once with X_OK.
   wrowe:     It would seem we only need to test for X_OK?

 * mod_disk_cache: Decline the opportunity to cache if the response is
    a 206 Partial Content. This stops a reverse proxied partial response
    from becoming cached, and then being served in subsequent responses.
    Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=951222&view=rev
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-cache-partial-2.2.patch
    +1: minfrin
    niq asks: I can see the logic of not cacheing partial responses,
    but why should mod_disk_cache worry about them if mod_cache allows
    them, as in the following proposal?
    rpluem says: As poirier correctly mentions, the same must be done for mod_mem_cache
    as well.

  *) mod_cache: Explicitly allow cache implementations to cache a 206 Partial
     Response if they so choose to do so. Previously an attempt to cache a 206
     was arbitrarily allowed if the response contained an Expires or
     Cache-Control header, and arbitrarily denied if both headers were missing.
     Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=952823&view=rev
     2.2.x Patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-cache-partial2-2.2.patch
     +1: minfrin
     -1: rpluem: Until the patch proposal above for mod_disk_cache is backported
                 and a similar patch for mod_mem_cache is proposed (no backport
                 possible since mod_mem_cache is no longer in trunk) and
                 committed.

   * config: fix/optimize SSL connections for IE6 browsers
     PR 49484
     Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=966055
     2.2 patch: should apply cleanly
     +1: gstein
     -0: sf: If we change it, then change it to something that will be OK for
         MSIE 10, too. Also, some people recommend keeping ssl-unclean-shutdown
         for newer versions of MSIE.
         See http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=127970632901262&w=2 and
         the links therein.

   * mod_cache: Check the request to determine whether we are allowed
     to return cached content at all, and respect a "Cache-Control:
     no-cache" header from a client. Previously, "no-cache" would
     behave like "max-age=0".

     2.2.x patch: trunk patch works
     +1: minfrin

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

  * core: Support wildcards in both the directory and file components of
    the path specified by the Include directive.
    Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=909878&view=rev
                 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=917735&view=rev
                 http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=917759&view=rev
    2.2.x patch: http://people.apache.org/~minfrin/httpd-wildcard+docs2.patch
    Submitted by: minfrin, poirier
    +1: minfrin, jim, poirier
    -1: wrowe [This introduces new invalid paths which do not resolve to any
               configuration file paths, increasing the probability of unreported
               syntax errors to further confuse the administrator.]

  * srclib/pcre and vendor/pcre
    http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/pkg-pcre.html

    update to pcre-7.8
    outcome: remove from trunk, leave alone in branches/2.2.x and branches/2.0.x

 * core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
   with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
   original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
   with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
   providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
   Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
   which can accept additional mode and flag data.  Convert common
   provider version strings to macros.
   The core purpose of this pile of patches is to avoid unnecessary
   authn/z hooks when a single request spawns large numbers of internal
   requests to which an identical set of httpd configurations apply.
   This permits modules such as mod_authn_dbd and mod_dav to work together
   acceptably.
   Because certain external modules such as mod_authz_svn rely on the old
   behaviour, this optimization can be made only when all authn/z hooks and
   providers are registered with the appropriate flag.
   It would be excellent if Windows and NetWare people could ensure this
   builds correctly.
   In particular, mod_auth.h must be included into request.c and I've left
   mod_auth.h under modules/aaa rather than try to replicate wrowe's work
   in trunk moving all the include files around.
   I'm open to suggestions that this remain in trunk only, but in that case,
   it would be very helpful to know whether most people expect a 2.4 branch
   or just a 3.0 branch to be next.  If 3.0, some of the backwards
   compatibility work could potentially be ditched.

   -0: jim (would prefer to see in 2.4, and to push 2.4 out)

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
