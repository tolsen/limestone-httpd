CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
     (revised proposal dealing with wrowe's concerns).
     trunk:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=422178  (code)
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/manual/mod/mod_proxy.xml?r1=420990&r2=421725 (docs)
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=589371  (code+docs)
     2.2.x:
       http://people.apache.org/~niq/proxy-interp.patch
     rpluem says: Please add the documentation to your 2.2.x version of your
                  patch and a minor bump (changes to public mod_proxy.h) and
                  assume you are +1 to your own proposal.
     niq says: I'll attend to that.  As regards vote, I'm +1 on the proposal,
               but -0 on including this as a new feature in 2.2.7.
               Better IMHO to separate releasing it from the many bugfixes
               in 2.2.7 mod_proxy.  Hence +1 for 2.2.8.

   * configure / install: Make https port configurable.
      Trunk version of patch:
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=606316&view=rev
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=606806&view=rev
      Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
         http://people.apache.org/~fuankg/diffs/sslport.diff
      +1: fuankg, wrowe
      wrowe notes; Win32 is already ready for this, and there's no rush
      to push this into the immediate next-release.

   * mod_ssl: Add server name indication (RFC 4366) support (PR 34607).
      Trunk version of patch:
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=606190
      Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
         http://people.apache.org/~fuankg/diffs/httpd-2.2.x-sni.diff
      +1: fuankg
      +0: like ssl upgrade of 2.2, perhaps this is a good reason to bring
          httpd-2.4 to completion?  vhost changes could be disruptive to
          third party module authors.
      -1: rpluem: jorton found some problems with the trunk version and they
                  should be fixed / discussed in trunk before we backport.
      -1: wrowe until the next release is out the door

  * various modules: Silence some compiler warnings
      Trunk version of patch:
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=599651&view=rev
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=608508&view=rev
      Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
         Trunk version of patch works
      +1: rpluem,

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
     Trunk version of patch:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=491922
     2.2.x version of patch:
       http://people.apache.org/~chrisd/patches/mod_dbd_pools_groups/mpm_child_init-beos-2.2.x.patch
     +0: chrisd (abstaining; unable to test)

    * PKCS#7: backport PCKS#7 patches from trunk.
      +1 ben
      jerenkrantz: What's the revision number to backport?
      wrowe asks: ditto jerenkrantz
      sctemme: svn blame suggests r424707
      rpluem: Digging through the history suggests that
              r424735
              r424821
              r424823
              need to be added to this. See also
